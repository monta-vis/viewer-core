# Web Application Testing

To test local web applications, write native Python Playwright scripts.

**Helper Scripts Available**:
- `scripts/env_config.py` - **Environment detection** (Docker vs Host) and correct URLs
- `scripts/test_users.py` - **Test credentials** (sofia, toni, jonas) - auto-loaded
- `scripts/with_server.py` - Manages server lifecycle (supports multiple servers)

**Always run scripts with `--help` first** to see usage. DO NOT read the source until you try running the script first and find that a customized solution is abslutely necessary. These scripts can be very large and thus pollute your context window. They exist to be called directly as black-box scripts rather than ingested into your context window.

## Decision Tree: Choosing Your Approach

```
User task → Is it static HTML?
    ├─ Yes → Read HTML file directly to identify selectors
    │         ├─ Success → Write Playwright script using selectors
    │         └─ Fails/Incomplete → Treat as dynamic (below)
    │
    └─ No (dynamic webapp) → Is the server already running?
        ├─ No → Run: python3 scripts/with_server.py --help
        │        Then use the helper + write simplified Playwright script
        │
        └─ Yes → Reconnaissance-then-action:
            1. Navigate and wait for networkidle
            2. Take screenshot or inspect DOM
            3. Identify selectors from rendered state
            4. Execute actions with discovered selectors
```

## Example: Using with_server.py

To start a server, run `--help` first, then use the helper:

**Single server:**
```bash
python3 scripts/with_server.py --server "npm run dev" --port 5173 -- python3 your_automation.py
```

**Multiple servers (e.g., backend + frontend):**
```bash
python3 scripts/with_server.py \
  --server "cd backend && python3 server.py" --port 3000 \
  --server "cd frontend && npm run dev" --port 5173 \
  -- python3 your_automation.py
```

To create an automation script, include only Playwright logic (servers are managed automatically):
```python
from playwright.sync_api import sync_playwright

with sync_playwright() as p:
    browser = p.chromium.launch(headless=True) # Always launch chromium in headless mode
    page = browser.new_page()
    page.goto('http://localhost:5173') # Server already running and ready
    page.wait_for_load_state('networkidle') # CRITICAL: Wait for JS to execute
    # ... your automation logic
    browser.close()
```

## Reconnaissance-Then-Action Pattern

1. **Inspect rendered DOM**:
   ```python
   page.screenshot(path='/tmp/inspect.png', full_page=True)
   content = page.content()
   page.locator('button').all()
   ```

2. **Identify selectors** from inspection results

3. **Execute actions** using discovered selectors

## Common Pitfall

❌ **Don't** inspect the DOM before waiting for `networkidle` on dynamic apps
✅ **Do** wait for `page.wait_for_load_state('networkidle')` before inspection

## Montavis: Dev Quick Login (RECOMMENDED)

The login page has **4 Dev Quick Login buttons** for fast authentication without typing credentials:

| Button | Email | Password | Role |
|--------|-------|----------|------|
| Julian | julian@montavis.tech | j | Admin |
| Jonas | jonas@montavis.tech | j | User |
| Toni | toni@delonghi.de | t | CompanySuperUser |
| Sofia | sofia@delonghi.de | s | CompanySuperUser |

**Playwright usage - click the button directly:**
```python
# Fast login via Dev Quick Login button
page.goto(FRONTEND_URL)
page.wait_for_load_state('networkidle')
page.click('button:has-text("Julian")')  # or "Jonas", "Toni", "Sofia"
page.wait_for_load_state('networkidle')
# Now logged in!
```

This is **much faster** than filling the login form manually.

## Montavis: Environment Detection (REQUIRED)

**ALWAYS use `env_config.py`** to get correct URLs - it auto-detects Docker vs Host:

```python
import sys
sys.path.insert(0, '/workspace/.claude/skills/webapp-testing/scripts')
from env_config import get_urls

urls = get_urls()
FRONTEND_URL = urls['frontend']  # Auto-detected
BACKEND_URL = urls['backend']    # Auto-detected

page.goto(FRONTEND_URL)
# API calls: use BACKEND_URL + "/api/v1/..."
```

Or run directly to check environment:
```bash
python3 /workspace/.claude/skills/webapp-testing/scripts/env_config.py
```

### Why?
- **Host:** `localhost:5183` (frontend), `localhost:5181` (backend)
- **Docker:** `localhost:5210` (frontend), `host.docker.internal:5181` (backend)
- **env_config.py** detects which environment and returns correct URLs

### Python Command

| Environment | Command |
|-------------|---------|
| Docker (worktrees) | `python3` |
| Host (main) | `python` |

## Best Practices

- **Use bundled scripts as black boxes** - To accomplish a task, consider whether one of the scripts available in `scripts/` can help. These scripts handle common, complex workflows reliably without cluttering the context window. Use `--help` to see usage, then invoke directly.
- Use `sync_playwright()` for synchronous scripts
- Always close the browser when done
- Use descriptive selectors: `text=`, `role=`, CSS selectors, or IDs
- Add appropriate waits: `page.wait_for_selector()` or `page.wait_for_timeout()`
